--->Hi GitHubbers!  I am a professor of Analytics at Cal State Fullerton.  I'm looking for some fun data sets where students will need
to augment the data with web scraping or other extraction methods to create interesting vizualizations.  If the data has a finance/accounting
bent to it, all the better.  Last semester we did a great bitcoin project.
